# libretrogd - 'Slime Stabbing Simulator' Demo

A fairly more involved demo which was originally written to test out and learn how good/bad libretrogd's entity,
events and state management support is to use in practice. I learnt a lot from it, and have many ideas to improve 
things now.

**Warning! There is quite a bunch of slow/sloppy code in here!**

Simply do `cargo run` from this directory to try it out.
