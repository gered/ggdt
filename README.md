# ggdt: Gered's Game Dev Tools

This is a purely for-fun project of mine. It's a personal set of retro-like/inspired game development tools for
use in my own projects.

It started with a focus on DOS "VGA mode 13h"-style limitations, but is not going to be limited to just that
into the future and will be expanded on as I need it to do other things. It should be noted that in this project I will 
do a lot of (poor) reinventing of the wheel ... because it's fun. Stringing together existing libraries all the time
is dull after a while.

I'm not an expert in Rust and am probably still doing a great many things unidiomatically. But I'm learning, and
that is at least half the point of this project in the first place.

See the `/examples` directory for some demo apps. These will be added to over time.
