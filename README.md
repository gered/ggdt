# libretrogd

Rust library / mini-framework for "retro-style" games development.

This is a not-so-serious project of mine for hobbyist game dev efforts of my own with some silly DOS-inspired
limitations built in. The major one being that graphics are limited to 256 colours, like DOS VGA mode 13h, with a
similar low-resolution.

See the `/examples` directory for some demo apps. These will be added to over time.

**This is FAR from finished and is not really what I'd consider "production-ready" ... and it probably won't be at any
point in the near future.**

This project is one I started working on to help teach myself Rust and to get more comfortable working with it. As such,
there is almost certainly a lot of bad code in here!
